  <p>Seth MacFarlane first started as a writer for Hannah-Barbera and would go on to create his own series that would launch his career.

  <p>Seth MacFarlane was born on October 26, 1973 to Ronald Milton MacFarlane and Ann Perry in Kent, Connecticut. 
    Seth first became interested in illustrations at a young age when he started watching cartoons and would attempt to draw them himself. \
    He would go on to study film, video, & animation at the Rhode Island School of Design (RISD). While at RISD, he also performed stand-up comedy which would help him find his voice. 
    He would eventually go on to pitch <em>Family Guy</em> to <strong>Fox</strong> which in turn he was offered a budget of $50,000 to produce a pilot that could potentially lead to a series. 
    It took him a long excruciating 6 months to present the pilot to <strong>Fox</strong> and a series was immediately ordered.  
  </p>

  <h3><strong>Television Career</strong></h3>
  <p> Seth's career in television first started at Hanna-Barbera working on existing shows such as <em>Dexter's Laboratory, Cow and Chicken, and Johnny Bravo</em>. 
    After the success of <em>Family Guy</em>, he would go on to create spin offs, soundtracks, and video games based of <em>Family Guy</em>. In addition to other
    animated works like <em>American Dad</em>, I eventually ended staring and producing my own sci-fi comedy-drama series called <em>The Orville.</em>
  
  </p>

  <h3><strong>Film Career</strong></h3>
  <p>Seth's film career isn't as long as his tv career but it has proven to be successful nonetheless. His first film was <em>Ted</em> which had a budget of $50 - $65 million with a box office of $549 million.
  A <em>Ted 2</em> would later be produced and a television series is currently in the works. The only other film in his resume is <em>A Million Ways to Die in the West</em> which he stared and co-wrote in 2014.</p>
  
  <h3><strong>Music Career</strong></h3>
  <p>In 2010, Seth MacFarlane signed a record deal with Universal Republic Records and released his debut album, <em>Music is Better than Words</em> in 2011. Alongside with multiple albums, Seth also collaborated with multiple 
    artists such as Sara Bareilles, Norah Jones, Elizabeth Gilliese, and Ariana Grande.</p>
